## Next steps

Here are recommended next actions you can pick from:

1. Convert this document into a ready-to-paste `README.md` for the root of the main repository.
2. Generate an initial folder tree containing `README.md` templates for each category (copy/paste-ready files).
3. Create a ZIP archive with the folder structure and all template files ready for upload.

Tell me which option you prefer and I will prepare the files immediately.
